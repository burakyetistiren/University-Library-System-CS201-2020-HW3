University Library System

In this homework, an imaginary library system is implemented by using linked lists. The library system stores
information about students and books. The students are able to check out books from the library
and are able to return them to the library. For each student, the system stores an id, name, and a list
of books that she/he checked out. Each book is represented by its id, title, and year. You can assume
that there is a single copy of each book in the system.
